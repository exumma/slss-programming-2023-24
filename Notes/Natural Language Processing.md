# Natural Language Processing

## Output
We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen
We use the `print()`function to display output 

```python
print("Your text goes in here.")
```

## [[Headers]]

## Comments
Comments are piece of text that are *not* interpreted by Python.
This means that the text is **ignored**.
We use the # symbol to make comments.

```python
# This is a comment.
```

## Input 
We grab information from the user using the `input()`.
When we run the function, it does two things:
1. It **waits** for the user to write something or nothing
2.  The user presses **Enter/Return** to indicate that they're finished.

```python
input ()

input (<prompt>).          # prints out the prompt then waits
```

## Variables
Variables allow us to **store** information for the time that our app is running.

```python
favourite_food = input("What is your favourite food? ")
```

`favourite_food` -> name of the variable
`=` -> assignment operator
`input...` -> value 

# [[Strings]]
